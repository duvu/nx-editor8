# Python Code Review and Refactoring Task

## Summary
Reviewed Python code in `mainZ.py` and applied corrections based on the provided coding standards.

## Changes Made ✅

### 1. Import Organization ✅
- Grouped imports into three sections:
  - Standard library imports
  - Third-party imports (none in this file)
  - Local application imports
- Sorted imports alphabetically within each group
- Removed unnecessary comments

### 2. Naming Conventions ✅
- Renamed functions and variables from camelCase to snake_case:
  - `errorHandler` → `error_handler`
  - `extractArticle` → `extract_article`
  - `processImageUrl` → `process_image_url`
  - `imageValidatorProcessor` → `image_validator_processor`
  - And many others

### 3. Hard-Coding Prevention ✅
- Extracted magic numbers into constants:
  - `MIN_REQUIRED_IMAGES = 5`
  - `IMAGE_EXTENSIONS = r'\.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif|bmp|webp|tiff|svg)(\?|$|#)'`

### 4. Code Refactoring ✅
- Split `script_processor` function to improve single responsibility principle:
  - Extracted `get_image_lines` function
- Improved main function structure:
  - Simplified by removing unnecessary keep_alive function
  - Added comprehensive exception handling

### 5. Documentation ✅
- All function docstrings were already following Google-style format
- Made sure argument descriptions match renamed parameters

### 6. Error Handling ✅
- Improved error handling in main function
- Added proper exception logging with `logger.exception()`
- Ensured resources are properly cleaned up

### 7. Signal Handling ✅
- Fixed Ctrl+C handling to ensure proper application termination
- Used os._exit(0) to force immediate termination
- Added robust error handling in signal handler
- Added a KeyboardInterrupt fallback in case signal handling fails

### 8. Command-line Interface ✅
- Added command-line argument support using argparse
- Implemented dual operation modes:
  - File mode: Process files directly with --input-file and --output-file
  - Queue mode: Process messages from RabbitMQ queues
- Added options for customizing:
  - Input/output file paths
  - Queue names
  - Logging level
  - Article title
- Implemented file processing function to handle direct file processing

## Usage Examples
```bash
# Process a file directly
python mainZ.py --input-file article.txt --output-file result.json --title "My Article"

# Run in queue mode with custom queue names
python mainZ.py --queue-mode --input-queue custom_input --output-queue custom_output

# Set custom logging level
python mainZ.py --log-level DEBUG --input-file article.txt --output-file result.json
```

## Recommendations for Further Improvement
- Consider adding unit tests to ensure functionality remains intact after refactoring
- Review error handling to make sure exceptions are properly caught and logged
- Consider implementing a more robust configuration system for additional settings 
- Consider breaking down the file into smaller modules if it grows beyond 300 lines
